PAYMENTS (Stripe / PayPal) - PLACEHOLDERS
----------------------------------------
This project includes placeholders to integrate payments.

Stripe:
- You must create a backend (Node/Express) that creates Stripe Checkout Sessions.
- The frontend can call /create-checkout-session and redirect to session.url.
- Do NOT include secret keys in frontend.

PayPal:
- Use PayPal Checkout SDK or server-side integration.
- Follow PayPal docs to create orders server-side.

If you want, I can create a Node.js backend sample that integrates Stripe Checkout securely.
